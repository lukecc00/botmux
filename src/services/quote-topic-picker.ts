/**
 * Collects the 话题 (Feishu threads) of a chat for the `/quote` picker.
 *
 * Why this exists: Feishu's quote-reply UI can only reference a SINGLE message
 * — there is no "quote this 话题" affordance. Users who wanted the bot to read
 * another 话题 in the same group had no way to point at it. `/quote` fills that
 * gap: it renders the chat's 话题 as a picker, and reading the chosen one is a
 * plain `im/v1/messages` call against the thread container.
 *
 * Discovery is deliberately derived from the CHAT tail rather than any per-bot
 * session registry, because the whole point is to reach 话题 the bot has no
 * session in — including 话题 driven by a different bot, or by humans only.
 * The bot's membership in the chat is the entire authorization boundary: Lark
 * refuses `im/v1/messages` with 230002 ("Bot/User can NOT be out of the chat")
 * for anything else, so there is no separate permission model to maintain here.
 *
 * Grouping rule (verified against live `im/v1/messages` output):
 *   • A 话题 root message carries `thread_id` (`omt_…`) and NO `root_id`.
 *   • Its replies carry the SAME `thread_id` plus a `root_id` pointing at the
 *     root message.
 *   • A 普通群 reply chain (not a 话题) has `root_id` but NO `thread_id`.
 *   • A flat top-level message has neither.
 * So the group key is `thread_id ?? root_id`, and messages with neither are
 * top-level chatter that belongs to no 话题 — excluded, since there is nothing
 * to "pick".
 *
 * NOTE on counts: the chat container returns only a 话题's ROOT message, never
 * its replies (confirmed live: a 46-message page held 8 `thread_id` messages
 * for 8 distinct 话题 — exactly one root each). So this scan cannot know how
 * long a 话题 is, and the picker deliberately shows no message count rather
 * than a "1+" that would imply the 话题 is a single message. The real count is
 * reported after reading, where it is actually known.
