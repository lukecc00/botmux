/**
 * Per-turn publication of the acting CLI identity.
 *
 * This is where the three pieces meet: the bot's {@link TriggerUserAuthConfig}
 * policy, the per-person token store, and the session identity file a wrapper
 * sources. It runs once per turn, just before the turn reaches the CLI.
 *
 * The single rule it enforces: **the credentials published for a turn belong to
 * the person who sent that turn, or nothing is published.** There is no path
 * here that reads another person's token — the sender's open_id is the only key
 * ever used, and when it yields nothing the previous file is DELETED rather than
 * left in place. A stale file would mean the next command silently runs as the
 * previous person, which is the exact failure the feature exists to remove.
